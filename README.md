This is the repository for blog post [Zustand Setup: Building Ecommerce App with Cart Actions](https://everythingcs.dev/blog/zustand-setup-react-ecommerce-cart-actions/).

Starter code branch contains the starter file for this project.

I have developed a basic ecommerce app with cart actions like adding item to cart, increasing and decreasing quantity, removing items from cart etc. using Zustand.

This is a part of Global State Management guide which is currently in active developent in which I am exploring the various global state management techniques in React.
